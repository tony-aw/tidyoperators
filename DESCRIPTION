Description: The 'tidyoperators' R-package adds some much needed infix operators,
    and a few functions,
    to make your R code much more tidy.
    It includes infix operators for the negation of logical operators (exlcusive-or, not-and, not-in),
    in-place modifying mathematical arithmetic,
    string arithmetic,
    string subsetting,
    in-place modifying string arithmetic,
    in-place modifying string subsetting,
    and in-place modifying unreal replacers.
    Moreover, it includes some helper functions for more complex string arithmetic,
    some of which are missing from popular R packages like stringi.
    All base R expressions options (Regex, perl, fixed, useBytes, ignore.case) are available for all string-pattern-related functions, as well as all options from stringi (regex, fixed, boundary, charclass, coll).
    This package also allows integrating third-party parallel computing packages
    for some of its functions.
    Although this package has zero dependencies, it can run stringi functions,
    provided the user has the stringi R-package installed.
