Description: The 'tidyoperators' R-package adds some much needed infix operators,
    and a few functions,
    to make your R code much more tidy.
    It includes infix operators for the negation of logical operators (exclusive-or, not-and, not-in),
    safer float (in)equality operators,
    in-place modifying mathematical arithmetic,
    string arithmetic,
    string sub-setting,
    in-place modifying string arithmetic,
    in-place modifying string sub-setting,
    "which"-operators,
    and in-place modifying unreal replacers.
    Moreover, it includes some helper functions for more complex string arithmetic,
    some of which are missing from popular R packages like stringi.
    All base R expressions options (Regex, fixed, coll, boundary, charclass)
    are available for all string-pattern-related functions,
    as well as all options from stringi (regex, fixed, boundary, charclass, coll).
    This package also allows integrating third-party parallel computing packages
    for some of its functions.
